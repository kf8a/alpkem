The balance was probably tared for the u-cup prior to the tin, so it probably read around -10g before the tin was placed on it and not tared.  So before any soil was placed in the tin, it is likely the balance showed approx. +10g.  Using this reasoning, the % soil moisture for this plot is around 13.4.  SV 4/10/2007"
