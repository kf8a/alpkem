Feature: Manage user_sessions
  In order to enter the site
  An unsigned-in but valid user
  wants to be signed in
  
  Scenario: Login registered user
# There does not seem to be a good way to test this automatically
#    Given a user exists with an identity url of "http://alpkemtest.myopenid.com"
#     And I am on the new_user_session page
#    When I fill in "user_identity_url" with "http://alpkemtest.myopenid.com"
#      And I press "Sign in"
#      And I fill in "password" with "alpkemtest"
#    Then I should see "Sign Out"
    
#  Scenario: Don't login unregistered user
#    Given I am on the new user_sessions page
#    When I fill in "user_identity_url" with "notauser@example.com"
#      And I press "Sign in"
#    Then I should see "This OpenID URL is not associated with any registered user"
